## What is it?

This is a slightly modified implementation of Google's [Mars Rover Challenge](https://code.google.com/archive/p/marsrovertechchallenge/#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20control%20a,moving%20from%20its%20current%20spot.).
It was made as a template for other Svelty things and general learning ðŸ’¡.

## How to operate it

You must have the necessary qualifications for operating extraterrestrial vehicles. After extensive training, you may use the Graphical Control Console&trade; to perform a variety of tasks. Inadequate guidance can lead to catastrophic failure, so you must ensure a proper syntax is followed. 

**To set the plateau in which you will be operating in**: `plateau: 10 10`
> *Only your superior officer should be able to set the theatre of rover operations. Any attempt to do so without sign off, level 3 approval (refer to section 4.3), committee approval, and an enhanced training course, will lead to immediate removal from the operations team, and subsequent charges.*

**To land the rover, specify a new name, followed by coordinates and cardinal direction:** `walle land: 4 4 e`

**To move, specify an existing rover's name and then one of `l(left) r(right) m(move)`:** `walle instruct: mmmlmmrmm`
